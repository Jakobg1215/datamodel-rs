A rust library to serialize and deserialize Valve's proprietary DMX file format.

# IMPORTANT

This libaray is still a work in progress and I can't give it all my time to work on it.

# What is DMX?

Dmx is a file format created by Valve Corporation to save data with a key-value format. It is primarly used for SFM but has other uses like 3d models, partical options, and other stuff.

# What is needed?

Here is a list for what this libary needs.

- Documentation
- Fix all FIXMEs
- Support for all versions
- A custom way to create your own attribute
- All serialize and deserializers that valve has
- A good type system
- Tests
- A system for format validation
